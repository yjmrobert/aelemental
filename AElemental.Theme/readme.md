# AElemental Themeing

## Using default theme (CSS)

To use the default theme without any modifications there is no need to import the `AElemental.Blazor.Theme` nuget
package as the compiled css file `elemental.min.css` is included by default in `AElemental.Blazor`.

```html
<link
  href="_content/AElemental.Blazor/css/elemental.min.css"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>
```

## Importing default theme (SCSS)

To import the default theme you will have to install the `AElemental.Blazor.Theme` nuget package from nuget.

```ps
dotnet add package AElemental.Blazor.Theme --version 1.0.21168.1
```

Once you have this imported, it will copy over on every build the AElemental `.scss` stylesheets into
a `/Styles/elemental-theme/` directory.

> Note: This will happen every build. If you have made changes to these files - they will be overwritten on build. It's
> better to either copy or reference them in a separate file.

At this point you can simply import the default using standard SASS.

```scss
@use '/path/to/elemental-theme/theme.scss'

@include theme.styles;
```

## Setting up SASS in your project

### Via On-Build

#### Setup NPM

To setup sass compilation on build you'll need to create a `package.json` file in your project and
run `npm install sass --save-dev`. For more information on install sass you
can [read their documentation](https://sass-lang.com/install).

Add an npm script to your `package.json` to compile the sass when run. Here is an example `package.json` file for
reference

```json
{
  "name": "elemental.theme",
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "description": "Elemental Theme SCSS Scripts",
  "devDependencies": {
    "sass": "^1.35.1"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build-css": "sass Styles/_index.scss:wwwroot/elemental.css && sass --style=compressed Styles/_index.scss wwwroot/elemental.min.css"
  },
  "author": "Apption",
  "license": "Apache-2.0"
}
```

#### Setup `.csproj`

Add the following snippets to your `.csproj`.

```xml
<Target Name="PreBuild" BeforeTargets="PreBuildEvent">
  <Exec Command="npm run build-css" />
</Target>
```

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <!-- File with mtime of last successful npm install -->
  <NpmInstallStampFile>node_modules/.install-stamp</NpmInstallStampFile>
</PropertyGroup>
<Target Name="NpmInstall" BeforeTargets="BeforeBuild" Inputs="package.json" Outputs="$(NpmInstallStampFile)">
  <Exec Command="npm i sass --save-dev" />
  <Touch Files="$(NpmInstallStampFile)" AlwaysCreate="true" />
</Target>
```

In the first snippet, the `PreBuild` target will execute the npm script that we defined in the previous section before
building the project.

In the other snippet, we're verifying that the sass compilation library has been installed into the `node_modules`
directory and is available for the npm compilation script.

That's it. When you build your project it will execute the npm script and compile the sass to the specified output and
be available for consumption by the browser.

> Note: Be sure to reference your new stylesheet in your `_Hosts.cshtml` or `index.html` files.

### Via CLI

To run the sass compilation you can always open your terminal in the same directory as your `package.json` and run the
command to compile the sass.

```
sass Styles/_index.scss:wwwroot/elemental.css
```

> Tip: You can append `--watch` at the end of the command to keep the compiler open and it will continue compiling
> stylesheets whenever they or their dependencies change.

## Overwriting the Theme

To override the theme you can call the configure method and pass in the configuration map for the override properties on
the component.

> Tip: It's recommended to copy the configuration map of the component you want to overwrite into a new file as a
> baseline.

Here's an example of overwriting the button styles in AElemental

```scss
@use 'Styles/theme'; // elemental theme

$newButtonOptions: (
  'default': (
    'background-color': red,
    'border-color': red,
    '&:hover': (
      'background-color': orange,
      'border-color': orange,
    ),
  ),
  'blue': (
    'background-color': blue,
    'border-color': blue,
    '&:hover': (
      'background-color': aqua,
      'border-color': aqua,
    ),
  ),
);

$overrides: (
  'button': $newButtonOptions,
);

@include theme.custom($overrides);
```

To see the list of keys for the component overrides you can check out the values in the `_theme.custom` mixin.

Some of the components have complex overrides that involve multiple variables. These variables are defined in the
components `configure` mixin.

As an example, here is how you would nest an override for `AeSteps`

```scss
@use 'Styles/theme'; // elemental theme

$stepOptions: (// values);

$horizontalStepOptions: (// values);

$stepOverrides: (
  'stepOptions': $stepOptions,
  'horizontalStepOptions': $horizontalStepOptions,
);

$overrides: (
  'step': $stepOverrides,
);

@include theme.custom($overrides);
```

It is recommended to maintain your overrides in seperate files and to import them into a single override entry point
file.
